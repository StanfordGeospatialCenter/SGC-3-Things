# SGC-Quickstart

 3 things you can do to jumpstart your use of spatial data in your research and teaching at Stanford (plus more if we have time!). 

 If you have any trouble getting into any of these resources, reach out to us at stanford-geospatial@stanford.edu 

## https://earthworks.stanford.edu 

* Basic search
* Using Facets
  * Resource Class (Roughly corresponds to where/how you would use it)
  * Data Type (Corresponds roughly to 'file type')
  * Provider (What institution is it coming from?)

* Downloading
* Code Snippets Example [https://earthworks.stanford.edu/catalog/nyu-2451-34156]
